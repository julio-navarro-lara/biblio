*Originally exported from Invenio https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio.*


Dependencies

* [file](http://linux.die.net/man/1/file)
* [pdftotext](http://linux.die.net/man/1/pdftotext)

Installation
============

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install refextract

Usage
=====

To get structured info from a publication reference:

.. code-block:: python

    from refextract import extract_journal_reference
    reference = extract_journal_reference("J.Phys.,A39,13445")
    print(reference)
    {
        'extra_ibids': [],
        'is_ibid': False,
        'misc_txt': u'',
        'page': u'13445',
        'title': u'J. Phys.',
        'type': 'JOURNAL',
        'volume': u'A39',
        'year': ''
     }


To extract references from a publication full-text PDF:

.. code-block:: python

    from refextract import extract_references_from_file
    reference = extract_references_from_file("some/fulltext/1503.07589v1.pdf")
    print(reference)
    [
            {'author': [u'F. Englert and R. Brout'],
             'doi': [u'10.1103/PhysRevLett.13.321'],
             'journal_page': [u'321'],
             'journal_reference': ['Phys.Rev.Lett.,13,1964'],
             'journal_title': [u'Phys.Rev.Lett.'],
             'journal_volume': [u'13'],
             'journal_year': [u'1964'],
             'linemarker': [u'1'],
             'title': [u'Broken symmetry and the mass of gauge vector mesons'],
             'year': [u'1964']}, ...
    ]

You can also extract directly from a URL:

.. code-block:: python

    from refextract import extract_references_from_url
    reference = extract_references_from_url("http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07589v1.pdf")
    print(reference)
    [
             {'author': [u'F. Englert and R. Brout'],
              'doi': [u'10.1103/PhysRevLett.13.321'],
              'journal_page': [u'321'],
              'journal_reference': ['Phys.Rev.Lett.,13,1964'],
              'journal_title': [u'Phys.Rev.Lett.'],
              'journal_volume': [u'13'],
              'journal_year': [u'1964'],
              'linemarker': [u'1'],
              'title': [u'Broken symmetry and the mass of gauge vector mesons'],
              'year': [u'1964']}, ...
    ]

Changes
=======

Version 0.2.2 (2017-07-17)

- Handle pyPDF2 internal errors.

Version 0.2.1 (2017-07-02)

- Named destinations may not always have left and top coordinates. This case is
  now handled gracefully: no TeXkeys are returned by ``extract_texkeys_from_pdf``
  instead of raising an uncaught exception.

- Makes ``CFG_PATH_GFILE`` and ``CFG_PATH_PDFTOTEXT`` configurable through
  shell variables, with fallback on the output of ``which``, in order to allow
  for easier containerization.

Version 0.2.0 (2017-06-26)

- Substantial rewrite of the API. In particular:

  * ``extract_references_from_file``, ``extract_references_from_string``, and
    ``extract_references_from_url`` now return a list of the references,
    instead of an object with keys ``stats`` and ``references``.

  * If the number of TeXkeys that were extracted from the PDF metadata matches
    the number of references parsed by RefExtract, an extra ``texkey`` field is
    added to each returned reference.

  * The API now raises exceptions when it encounters an unrecoverable error.

  * Finally, the API now returns the list of raw references on which
    ``refextract`` worked.

Version 0.1.0 (2016-01-12)

- Initial export from Invenio Software <https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio>
- Restructured into stripped down, standalone version
