Abstract-Traditional
multi-step
attack
correlation
approaches based on intrusion alerts face the challenge of
recognizing attack scenarios because these approaches require
complex pre-defined association rules as well as a high
dependency on expert knowledge. Meanwhile, they barely
consider the privacy issues. Under such circumstance, a novel
algorithm is proposed to construct multi-step attack scenarios
based on discovering attack behavior sequential patterns. It
analyzes time sequential characteristics of attack behaviors and
implements a support evaluation method. An optimized
candidate attack sequence generation method is applied to solve
the problem of pre-defined association rules complexity as well as
expert knowledge dependency. An enhanced k-anonymity method
is applied on this algorithm to realize privacy-preserving feature
Experimental results indicate that the algorithm has
comparatively better performance and accuracy on multi-step
attack correlation and reaches a well balance between efficiency
and privacy issues.

Introduction

According to the National Internet Emergency Center (CNCERT/CC)
network security situation analysis reports, most attacks are complex,
multi-step attack [1]. Such attacks have generally targeted attacks,
devastating huge and difficult to detect features. Moreover, the

process IS often attacked by a serIes of attacks steps closely
associated with the composition, such as intrusion detection,
vulnerability analysis, network penetration, privilege escalation
attack embodiment; the back door opened and cleared logs and so on.
Accordingly, the disclosure attack sequence for identifYing the major
signiticance of the attack.
In recent years, research associate in the field of network
security alarm more and more attention. In response to the
increasingly difficult security situation, the security co-organized
between the analysis and prevention is necessary. Privacy issues
become safety data sharing and collaborative analysis of one of the
major obstacle towards practical applications [10, lll. However, the
alarm associated with the conventional method of analysis based on
the analysis considered data security requirements are usually a
variety of password-based method has high computational
complexity [12, 131.
A Privacy-Preserving Multi-step Attack Correlation (PPMAC)
algorithm is proposed in this paper to discover attack behavior
sequential patterns on the protected alert set. With the target of
finding out attack sequences of global multi-step attacks, this method
can be used to predict invaders' future moves, and thus take proper
actions to decrease the impact from such intrusions efficiently. With
affordable computation cost, PPMAC has been proven to be more
efficient than traditional ones in attack scenarios construction with
consideration of sensitive information protection in alert set.

correlation processor as well as

analyzer, is on the right side, interacting with the network domain
through the function units of privacy-preserving agent and monitor.
PPMAC engine is composed of four functional units to realize
correlation:
(I) Global Attack Sequence Generator: to generate global
sequence of attack behaviors according to the order of start-time
attribute of alerts, which is mapped into attack signature identifiers of
consecutive integers.
(2) Candidate Attack Sequence DB: to store the selected
candidate attack sequences from the global attack sequence.
(3) Maximal Attack Behavior Set Handler: to produce all the
maximal attack behaviors with minimum support, the pre-defined
parameter.
(4) Maximal Attack Sequence Miner: to discover multi-step
attack scenarios from protected alert set based on attack behavior
sequence analysis. The mining results can be fed back to network
domains through monitor to defend complex intrusions.
Considering the different level of sensitivity of variant attributes
in the alert, this paper improves the k-anonymity method[2.ll l , a
classical privacy preserving method so as to preserve the alerts'
semantic as much as possible during the process of attributes
anonymization.

III. PPMAC Algorithms
The method to mine attack behavior sequential patterns is based on
the essence that various multi-step attack behaviors initiated by
attackers always appear in ordered sequences. That is, attackers
would perform certain action before carrying out next move, as logic.
The attack scenario in LLDOS 1.0[16] illustrates the general
character of multi-step attacks explicitly.
Consequently, the
sequential pattern analysis of alerts could be used to correlate various
suspicious activities that, if considered separately, would not have
enough evidence to detect complicated multi-step attacks.
Some terms are defined to clarify the PPMAC Algorithm:
Definition 1 Attribute Vector: the attribute vector of each
intrusion alert is defined as: {date, start-time, protocol, source-iP,
destination-iP, source-port, destination-port, attack-type}, with a
short term al={at/" "', ats}
Definition 2 Alert Set: triggered by lDSs when some intrusion
events are detected. Let AL be the alert set with a finite number of
attribute vectors al.
Definition 3 k-anonymity: let sd={sd/, "', sdj, 0<1;;i8 be
a vector of selected attributes from aI, which are the sensitive items
to be protected, sd ~ al. SD is the set of sd, as a sub set extracted
from AL, that is SD ~ AL. AL satisfies k-anonymity if and only if
each vector in SD accordingly, appears with at least k occurrences.
Stepl: Protect sensitive alert attributes by the improved
k-anonymity method k-anonymity method, One of the major
privacy-preserving methods, generally uses quasi-identifier to
support judging whether k-anonymity properties are met. In the
purpose of preserving privacy in intrusion alerts, the sensitive
attributes are the private items, instead of the quasi-identifier.
k-anonymity method is applied on selected sensitive attributes in
SD, while all other attributes remain unchanged. The discrete values
of sensitive alert attributes in AL are replaced by their generalization
values which are predefined based on domain's security policy. For
example, the original destination-iP, which is one of the main private
attributes, is generalized to its subnet address with 24bit mask or even
16bit mask. Uncertainty is introduced into the alert set but alert
regulations are kept for mining.

Generalized alert set ALe' as the output of privacy-preserving
agent, will be sent to PPMAC engine for multi-step attack correlation
analysis.
Step2: Multi-step attack correlation algorithm
This step is to discover maximal attack sequences, based on
Apriori -like theory.
(a) Mapping and grouping

To make the mining process more efficient, a one-to-one
mapping table between attack-type strings and a series of consecutive
integers is setup. That is, the integers represent the attack signature
identifier accordingly. All values of attack-type of alerts in ALe are
converted to integers according to the mapping rule.
Definition.4 Attack Set S: {s1, s2, "', sg}: the set of attack
signature identifier according to the attack types reported by lDSs.
There are generally some relationships among the alert attributes
in different steps of a mufti-step attack process, such as same
destination port number or Same into hop network segment of
destination IP address. All alerts in ALe are classified into groups by
protected destination-iP segments, which can recognize single-hop
and mufti-hop attacks.
(b) Constructing global attack sequence

After mapping and grouping, the global attack sequence
generator is for generating global attack sequence.
Definition 5 Attack Sequence <ap a2' "', an>: a sequence of
attack behaviors, where ai (1 ;;ii ;;in) ES.
Sort all alerts in each group by start-time ascending after
mapping and grouping procedure, to have the global attack sequences
by groups.
(c) Producing candidate attack sequence set

An attack scenario is a collection of intrusion events that have
occurred closely within a pre-defined time window. Therefore, an
iteration process is designed to retrieve the candidate attack sequence
set:
a) Initiate the time window with its beginning side at the
start-time ofthe first alert in the global attack sequence:
b) Pick up all alerts in which the start-time is in the scope of
time window:
c) Move the time window to the start-time of next alert:
d) Repeat step a) and c) till the end side of the time window
reaches the end ofthe sequence.
After applying the process in each global sequence, the attack
steps which fall the same attack scenario time window form a
candidate attack sequence. The candidate attack sequence set is
obtained through big data, and then is stored in the sequence matrix
database.
The set of candidate attack sequence is denoted as CAS, and the
candidate attack sequences in CAS are denoted as casp ' 1 ;;ip;;iTS
(d) Getting maximal attack behavior set

Definition 6 Sequence support:

Given two attack sequences

A=<aj' a2' "', an>andB=<b j • b 2, .... b m > (mi";n), ifaj=b j
and A is the subsequence of B (A can be reached by deleting some
data from B without changing any orders), it is represented as
sequence A contained in sequence B, or sequence B supports
sequence A, denoted as B t A.

In a set of attack sequence, attack sequence is maximal if it is
not contained in any other sequences. The key target of mining attack
behavior sequential patterns is to find the maximal attack sequences
among all candidate attack sequences by group. Each of the maximal
attack sequences will represent an attack Scenario. Support
evaluation method is applied to deduce the maximal attack

sequences.
Definition 7 Support of Attack Sequence SUPAS : the ratio of
between the number of candidate attack sequences supporting the
attack sequence A, denoted as CS, and the number of total candidate
attack sequences, denoted as TS, given in Eq. 1:

The number of rows of Cv is denoted as ICyl and the candidate

Definition 8 Support of Attack Behavior SUPAB : the ratio
between the number of a certain attack behavior aj in the global
attack sequence, denotes as AB , and the number of total behaviors

Attack behaviors which satisfy the predefined minimum support
threshold (min_sup) are called maximal attack behaviors.
The procedure to get maximal attack behavior set is the process
to produce attack sequence with only one behavior (] -sequence) as
well, denoted as L/. The maximal attack behavior set handler
produces L / as Algorithm 1 shows. The number of total maximal
attack behaviors is denoted as TA.

As described above, a conclusion can be drawn that the elements
in the maximal attack sequences must be the ones in the maximal
attack behavior set.
(e) Discovering maximal attack sequences

The maximal attack sequence miner looks for small attack
scenarios, and gets larger attack scenarios progressively. This process
is composed of two procedures: producing candidate maximal attack
sequence set Cy and corresponding maximal attack sequence set L y '
where y denotes the length or the attack behavior number of the
maximal attack sequence. This process will end on the condition that
no new sequence can be derived from Ly to Cy+ 1 ' which discovers all
the maximal attack sequences of Ly in the given intrusion event
sequences.

b) Scan the candidate attack sequence set from top to bottom and
read one attack sequence each time, in which process the support
count of each candidate maximal attack sequence in Cy are increased
while it is contained in the attack sequence. Obtain the maximal
attack sequences of Ly ' by deleting those candidate sequences whose
support count less than min_sup. The pseudo code for retrieving Ly is
shown in Algorithm 2.

Experimental Results

This section includes validation of the effectiveness and scalability of
PPMAC on multi-step attack correlation, and then compares the
performance of PPMAC with two traditional sequential pattern
mining algorithms: AprioriAll and GSP. All the experiments are
processed with DEF CON 9 datasets[15], one of the most
authoritative datasets of attack performed scenarios from DEF CON
organization.
Experiments have been performed in an intranet environment,
where TCP Replay, an open source replaying toolkit, is applied to
import the network flows into the deployed SNORT[14]. Table 1

The comparatively better result of correct multi-step attack
scenarios is achieved by PPMAC performing on the protected
datasets, which shows no capability loss on discovering attack
scenarios after privacy preserving process. The reason is that the
attributes of attack-type are fully involved in the process of
discovering attack behavior sequences. Meanwhile, PPMAC has
lower false positive ratio and false negative ratio than GSP, credit to
our novel method of producing candidate maximal attack sequences.

As proven in experiments, PPMAC is averagely around 10% to
500% faster than AprioriAll. When W is smaller and min-sup is
higher, GSP is around 30% faster than PPMAC, as PPMAC requires
protecting the sensitive attributes in original alerts. With the

1392

decreasing min-sup, more maximal attack behaviors in sequence, as
well as more candidate maximal attack sequences are generated.
Performance advantages of PPMAC are thus benefited from its
optimized method of producing candidate maximal attack sequence
set. The runtime gap between the two methods becomes bigger.
Generally, the total runtime of PPMAC increases with a decreasing
min-sup.

Fig. 3 shows the execution time of finding maximal attack
sequences in the experimental dataset with various attack scenario
time windows and min-sup values through PPMAC. In general,
increased time window leads to the extended length of candidate
attack sequences while decreased min-sup leads to the growth of
initial maximal attack behaviors. Joint effort of both factors should be
held liable for the rapid increment of processing time.
The effectiveness of alerts number versus the runtime is shown
in Fig. 4. It illustrates that the time cost keeps roughly linear in spite
of the different range of alert number.
