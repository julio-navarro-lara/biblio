Abstract: In the era of global Internet security threats, there is an urgent need for different organizations to cooperate and jointly fight against cyber attacks. We present an algorithm that combines a privacy-preserving technique and a multi-step attack-correlation method to better balance the privacy and availability of alarm data. This algorithm is used to construct multistep attack scenarios by discovering sequential attack-behavior patterns. It analyzes the time-sequential characteristics of attack behaviors and implements a support-evaluation method.
