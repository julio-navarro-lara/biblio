Abstract—This paper introduce a three-stage approach that
can automatically mining multi-step attack patterns from massive
alert data of web application firewalls. The first stage extracts
attack sequences, and the second stage clusters similar attack
sequences. At the last stage we recognize an attack pattern for
each cluster. We conducted our experiments on real-world WAF
alert data obtained from a famous Chinese ISP. Experimental
results show that different attackers using the same attack pattern
may have the same “attack background”.

I. I NTRODUCTION
WAF (Web Application Firewall), as an appliance to identify
common attacks, such as cross-site scripting and structured
query language injection, is widely used in web application
protection. WAF work depending on well-designed rules customized to the protected web applications. However, it is not
easy to configuring and maintaining these customized rules.
Once hackers launch a multi-step attack and other advanced
attacks, it’s difficult to extract attack sequences and further
recognize attack patterns from massive WAF alert data. In
reality, we have lots of different sequences, but we do not know
the rules hidden in these disordered attacks. Therefore, mining
multi-step attack patterns is an important and significant task
in WAF alert data analysis.
In this study, we propose a novel three-stage approach that
can automatically mining multi-step attack patterns from massive WAF alerts. The main idea is to cluster attack sequences
that are generated automatically, and then recognize an attack
pattern from each attack sequence cluster. Different from prior
approaches [1], [2], [3], our proposed approach does not need
any additional information except WAF alerts. Moreover, it is
can be implemented easily.
We evaluate our proposed approach on WAF alerts that are
collected from one real-world system. Experimental results
show that some seemingly unrelated alerts may have the same
“attack background” and other similar information in common.
This conclusion is manually verified by offline tracking the IP
addresses used by different attackers in our experiments. Thus,
our approach could make sense in analysis of massive WAF
alert data.
II. O UR A PPROACH
To mine multi-step attack patterns from massive WAF alert
data, there are three open problems needed to be addressed.
The first open problem is how to extract attack sequences,

which is defined as all the alerts that are trigged by the same
attack. The second open problem is how to put the similar
attack sequences together and constitute a cluster. At last,
we need to address the problem of recognizing the inherent
attack pattern from multiple similar attack sequences. Each
stage of our approach addresses one of the above problems
respectively, as described in detail in the following part.
Extract Attack Sequence: a WAF alert mainly consists of
alert time, attacked domain name, attacker IP address and
alert type (indicating the specific step during the process of
an attack). Each attack step may trigger many WAF alerts
of the same alert type. For WAF applications, we make a
reasonable assumption that each attacker IP address is involved
in every step of a multi-step attack, namely all the steps are
not launched sequentially with different IP addresses. Then
we can get many attack sequences with attacker IP address
and attacked domain name together as the primary keys1 . As
a attack does not last for ever, we think two continues WAF
alerts of the same attacker IP address and attacked domain
name belong to different attacks if the time interval between
their alert times is over 12 hours. Then a long attack sequence
is split into several short but rational attack sequences.
Cluster Attack Sequence: to complete the clustering operation, we should first give a tool to measure the distance of two
different attack sequences, which is the sum of the distance
of their attacker IP addresses, the distance of their attacked
domain names and the distance of their alert type sequences in
this paper. Regarding each IP address (domain name or alert
type sequence) as a string, we design an improved levenshtein
distance, referred to θLD hereafter, to measure its distance
with another IP address (domain name or alert type sequence).
Different from the classical levenshtein distance that gives
the same weight for differences at any position, θLD gives
different weights. In this paper we define θLD as follows:
θLD(x[1,i] , y[1,j] ) = θ × min(r, s, t)

r = θLD(x[1,i−1] , y[1,j] ) + 1

WAF alerts of the same alert type are merged into one alert.

Obviously we can get θLD based on the idea of dynamic
programming. Parameter θ measures the weight ratio between
two adjacent positions in a string. Smaller θ means that the
rearward position takes much more weights. For IP address,
domain name and alert type sequence, we do not use the
same θ. The θ for IP address (denoted as θip ) should be
more than 1, as two IP addresses with the same prefix is
more similar than two IP addresses with the same suffix of
the prefix’s length. The θ for alert type sequence (denoted as
θats ) should be 1, as alert types in different positions play
the same importance. The θ for domain name (denoted as
θdn ) should be less than 1, the primary reason is opposite to
that of IP address. We set the θdn = θ1ip in this paper. Note
that the same θLD implies different meanings for string pairs
of different lengths. Thus, we normalize θLD in this paper,
θLD(x[1,i] ,y[1,j] )
namely we use
as the distance of two strings
max(i,j)
x[1,i] and y[1,j] . Note that max(i, j) is the maximum value
of θLD(x[1,i] , y[1,j] ). A threshold η is introduced to limit the
distance of two attack sequences in the same cluster.
We argue that, in addition to WAF alerts, our approach does
not need any additional information to complete the clustering
operation.
Recognize Attack Pattern: multi-step attack patterns in a
attack sequence cluster are automatically discovered by the
longest common alert type subsequence extraction algorithm
based on the idea of dynamic programming.
III. E VALUATION
We evaluate our multi-step attack pattern mining approach,
in terms of the effectiveness of attack patterns, using realworld WAF alert data obtained from a famous Chinese ISP,
as outlined in Table I. We get 2574 different attack sequences
in total from obtained WAF alerts. As some multi-step attacks
are incomplete, we remove these attack sequences of only one
alert type, and get 368 effective active sequences.
Table II shows the distribution of alert types in our WAF
4
= 30%) take
alerts. We can find that top 4 alert types ( 13
more than 90% WAF alerts.
Figure 1 shows the change of the number of clusters with
the increase of η. We know the distance of any two attack
sequences is no more than 3. From Figure 1 we can find that
the number of clusters decreases with the increase of η, and
we can only get one cluster when η ≥ 1.8.
We use θip = 1.5 and η = 0.8 in our experiments. Under
these values we get 24 clusters, and we show several attack

We gather these IP addresses that attack the same domain
name with the same attack pattern in a very small time
window. We find that some IP addresses are parters to launch
an attack although they seem not to be, which is confirmed by
our offline investigations. This case verifies the effectiveness
of our multi-step attack pattern mining approach.
IV. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a novel three-stage approach
to mine multi-step attack patterns. We also introduced a new
tool to measure the distance of any two attack sequences. Experiments on real-world WAF alerts and offline investigations
show that different attackers with the same pattern may have
the same “attack background”, which verifies the effectiveness
of our approach.
