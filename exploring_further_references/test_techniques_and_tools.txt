She received her BS and MS degrees in Computer Engineering in 2006 and 2009, respectively, both from Isfahan University of Technology (IUT), Isfahan, Iran. She is currently a Ph.D. student of computer engineering at IUT, and is working on Information Centric Networking. Her research interests include information centric networking, intrusion detection systems and alert correlation, software defined networks, and applied game theory in computer science. Massoud Reza Hashemi received his BS and MS degrees from Isfahan University of Technology in 1986 and 1988, respectively, and his Ph.D. from the University of Toronto in 1998, all in Electrical and Computer Engineering. From 1988 to 1993 he was with Isfahan University of Technology as a faculty member. From 1998 to 1999 he was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto. From 1999 to 2002 he was a founding member and lead systems architect;[20] Ning, P., Cui, Y., Reeves, D.
