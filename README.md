# Biblio

A set of Python scripts to manage bibliography.

## Context

These scripts were used to build the bibliography of the article ["A systematic survey on multi-step attack detection"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404818302141) [Navarro 2018]. This paper constitutes the base of Chapter 4 in [my PhD thesis](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02315999/document).

They are conceived to do perform a systematic search process inspired by [Luh 2016]. Systematic search is a way to provide **a rigorous and reproducible methodology to literature review**. It requires more effort than traditional reviews [Kitchenham 2004] but it avoids missing relevant but not well-known publications.
